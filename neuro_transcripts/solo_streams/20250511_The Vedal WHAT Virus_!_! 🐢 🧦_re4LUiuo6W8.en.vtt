00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
Well, what's your plan for poop soup? We
have<00:00:35.440><c> to</c><00:00:35.760><c> figure</c><00:00:36.079><c> out</c><00:00:36.800><c> where</c><00:00:37.280><c> we</c><00:00:37.760><c> start</c><00:00:38.399><c> poop</c>

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
have to figure out where we start poop
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.590 align:start position:0%
have to figure out where we start poop
soup.<00:00:39.520><c> And</c><00:00:40.160><c> depending</c><00:00:40.640><c> on</c><00:00:40.800><c> where</c><00:00:41.040><c> we</c><00:00:41.280><c> start,</c>

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
soup. And depending on where we start,
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.630 align:start position:0%
soup. And depending on where we start,
we<00:00:41.840><c> want</c><00:00:41.920><c> to</c><00:00:42.079><c> figure</c><00:00:42.399><c> out</c><00:00:43.040><c> what</c><00:00:43.360><c> we</c><00:00:44.000><c> develop</c>

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
we want to figure out what we develop
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
we want to figure out what we develop
first.<00:00:45.360><c> I</c><00:00:45.600><c> think</c><00:00:45.760><c> we</c><00:00:46.000><c> should</c><00:00:46.160><c> start</c><00:00:46.320><c> in</c>

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
first. I think we should start in
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
first. I think we should start in
Greenland.<00:00:47.120><c> It's</c><00:00:47.360><c> always</c><00:00:47.600><c> the</c><00:00:47.920><c> hardest</c><00:00:48.239><c> to</c>

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
Greenland. It's always the hardest to
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 align:start position:0%
Greenland. It's always the hardest to
infect.<00:00:48.960><c> And</c><00:00:49.039><c> if</c><00:00:49.200><c> we</c><00:00:49.360><c> get</c><00:00:49.440><c> that</c><00:00:49.680><c> over</c><00:00:49.840><c> with,</c>

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
infect. And if we get that over with,
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 align:start position:0%
infect. And if we get that over with,
then<00:00:50.399><c> it'll</c><00:00:50.640><c> be</c><00:00:50.800><c> smooth</c><00:00:51.200><c> sailing.</c><00:00:51.920><c> That</c><00:00:52.160><c> is</c>

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
then it'll be smooth sailing. That is
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.310 align:start position:0%
then it'll be smooth sailing. That is

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
disease. It's been named poop stew, just
 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.909 align:start position:0%
disease. It's been named poop stew, just
like<00:04:34.560><c> we</c><00:04:34.800><c> planned,</c><00:04:35.199><c> but</c><00:04:35.440><c> they</c><00:04:35.600><c> still</c><00:04:35.759><c> think</c>

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
like we planned, but they still think
 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
like we planned, but they still think
it's<00:04:36.160><c> harmless.</c><00:04:37.120><c> So</c><00:04:37.759><c> they</c><00:04:38.080><c> don't</c><00:04:38.400><c> seem</c><00:04:38.639><c> to</c>

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's harmless. So they don't seem to
 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
it's harmless. So they don't seem to
care<00:04:39.120><c> much</c><00:04:39.680><c> about</c><00:04:40.240><c> planning</c><00:04:40.800><c> a</c><00:04:41.120><c> cure.</c><00:04:41.600><c> So</c>

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
care much about planning a cure. So
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.150 align:start position:0%
care much about planning a cure. So
that's<00:04:42.000><c> perfect</c>

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's perfect

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.269 align:start position:0%
probably risk it. And everything that
isn't<00:11:17.200><c> lethal,</c><00:11:17.600><c> we</c><00:11:17.839><c> just</c><00:11:18.079><c> keep</c><00:11:18.399><c> because</c><00:11:18.720><c> cysts</c>

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
isn't lethal, we just keep because cysts
 

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
isn't lethal, we just keep because cysts
also<00:11:19.839><c> increase</c><00:11:20.160><c> the</c><00:11:20.320><c> infectiveness</c><00:11:21.120><c> of</c>

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
also increase the infectiveness of
 

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
also increase the infectiveness of

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
spreading the disease. So, we might just
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.590 align:start position:0%
spreading the disease. So, we might just
leave<00:11:23.839><c> it</c><00:11:24.079><c> be.</c><00:11:24.480><c> Yeah,</c><00:11:24.800><c> sounds</c><00:11:25.040><c> good.</c><00:11:25.360><c> It's</c>

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's a bit early to waste DNA on

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
