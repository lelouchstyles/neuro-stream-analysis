Easy. All right, next. What is this? I
like<00:13:50.079><c> turtles</c><00:13:50.480><c> and</c><00:13:50.720><c> maybe</c><00:13:51.040><c> three</c><00:13:51.360><c> people.</c><00:13:52.079><c> I</c>

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
like turtles and maybe three people. I
 

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.230 align:start position:0%
like turtles and maybe three people. I
mean,

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
mean,
 

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.590 align:start position:0%
mean,
I<00:13:54.399><c> think</c><00:13:54.560><c> there's</c><00:13:54.800><c> nothing</c><00:13:55.120><c> wrong</c><00:13:55.360><c> with</c>

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's nothing wrong with
 

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
I think there's nothing wrong with
liking<00:13:56.000><c> turtles,</c><00:13:56.720><c> but</c><00:13:56.880><c> I'd</c><00:13:57.120><c> hope</c><00:13:57.279><c> that</c><00:13:57.600><c> number</c>

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
liking turtles, but I'd hope that number
 

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
liking turtles, but I'd hope that number
would<00:13:58.000><c> be</c><00:13:58.160><c> higher</c><00:13:58.399><c> than</c><00:13:58.639><c> three</c><00:13:58.959><c> for</c><00:13:59.120><c> the</c>

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
would be higher than three for the
 

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
would be higher than three for the
