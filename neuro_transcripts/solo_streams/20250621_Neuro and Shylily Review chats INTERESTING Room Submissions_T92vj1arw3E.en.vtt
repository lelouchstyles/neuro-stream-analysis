00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
could add a white board. I think I think
 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.469 align:start position:0%
could add a white board. I think I think
it<00:06:14.319><c> would</c><00:06:14.560><c> make</c><00:06:14.720><c> the</c><00:06:14.960><c> place</c><00:06:15.600><c> appear</c><00:06:16.160><c> less</c>

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
it would make the place appear less

it would make the place appear less

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.829 align:start position:0%

they had no reason not to. So, I'm
 

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
they had no reason not to. So, I'm
