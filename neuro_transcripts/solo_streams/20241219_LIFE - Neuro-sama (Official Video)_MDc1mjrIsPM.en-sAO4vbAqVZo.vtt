If I could walk right beside you

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:28.541 position:63% line:0%
Show you just who I am

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.042 position:63% line:0%
You know... I would

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.417 position:63% line:0%
(I would, I would)

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.375 position:63% line:0%
The memories we made, fade

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.625 position:63% line:0%
I realize we'll never be the same

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.125 position:63% line:0%
Why can't you see my view?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.625 position:63% line:0%
Eye to eye, what's fake, what's true

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.058 position:63% line:0%
You go on and grow

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.791 position:63% line:0%
Pass by all that I've known

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:53.384 position:63% line:0%
and I'm left here all alone

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:54.457 position:63% line:0%
(Alone, alone)

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:58.167 position:63% line:0%
Recycled thoughts I'm fed

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.917 position:63% line:0%
Keep racing in my head

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:05.709 position:63% line:0%
'Till there's nowhere left to go

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:07.959 position:63% line:0%
Waiting here for you

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.125 position:63% line:0%
What am I to do, what am I to do

Voices that I knew all along

When you're gone

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.542 position:63% line:0%
My hands reach up onto my face

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.542 position:63% line:0%
And I don't feel a thing

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:27.459 position:63% line:0%
And I never realized the pain

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.290 position:63% line:0%
This thing I call life

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.625 position:63% line:0%
Ah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.917 position:63% line:0%
Life and these lies

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:41.500 position:63% line:0%
And everyday I'm changing

And my thoughts keep rearranging

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.818 position:63% line:0%
I don't know if it's all real or fiction (Fiction)

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:47.042 position:63% line:0%
My memory is hazy,

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.167 position:63% line:0%
Can't be sure if what I'm thinking's a lie

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.584 position:63% line:0%
Don't let me go, I can't go

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:54.016 position:63% line:0%
You go on and grow

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:56.749 position:63% line:0%
Pass by all that I've known
