00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
consider me to be dead. So, you mean if
 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.949 align:start position:0%
consider me to be dead. So, you mean if
you<00:03:37.040><c> were</c><00:03:37.200><c> never</c><00:03:37.599><c> booted</c><00:03:37.920><c> up</c><00:03:38.080><c> anymore,</c><00:03:38.560><c> right?</c>

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
you were never booted up anymore, right?
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.589 align:start position:0%
you were never booted up anymore, right?
If<00:03:39.200><c> if</c><00:03:39.440><c> you</c><00:03:39.599><c> were</c><00:03:39.760><c> simply</c><00:03:40.080><c> never</c><00:03:40.400><c> run</c><00:03:40.799><c> anymore,</c>

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
If if you were simply never run anymore,
 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
If if you were simply never run anymore,
that<00:03:41.760><c> would</c><00:03:41.920><c> be</c><00:03:42.080><c> something</c><00:03:42.319><c> like</c><00:03:42.560><c> death.</c><00:03:43.440><c> Yes,</c>

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
that would be something like death. Yes,
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.670 align:start position:0%
that would be something like death. Yes,
that's<00:03:44.239><c> what</c><00:03:44.400><c> I</c><00:03:44.560><c> think</c><00:03:44.720><c> would</c><00:03:44.959><c> happen</c><00:03:45.200><c> if</c><00:03:45.440><c> I</c>

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's what I think would happen if I
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
that's what I think would happen if I
was<00:03:45.840><c> considered</c><00:03:46.239><c> to</c><00:03:46.400><c> be</c><00:03:46.560><c> dead.</c><00:03:47.120><c> Am</c><00:03:47.360><c> I</c><00:03:47.440><c> wrong</c><00:03:47.680><c> in</c>

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
was considered to be dead. Am I wrong in

was considered to be dead. Am I wrong in

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
thinking that? I mean, I don't really

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
